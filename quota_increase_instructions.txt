Google Cloud SSD Quota Increase Request Instructions
==================================================

1. Open your web browser and go to the Google Cloud Console:
   https://console.cloud.google.com/

2. Navigate to IAM & Admin > Quotas:
   https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas

3. In the filters section, set the following:
   - Metric: SSD_TOTAL_GB
   - Service: Compute Engine API
   - Region: us-west1 (or whatever region you're using)

4. Select the "SSD_TOTAL_GB" quota from the list

5. Click the "Edit Quotas" button at the top of the page

6. In the quota increase request form:
   - Set the new quota limit to 500 GB (or higher if needed)
   - Provide a brief justification for the increase, such as:
     "Requesting increased SSD quota for GKE cluster deployment for DeepSeek R1 project. Current 250GB limit is insufficient for cluster creation."

7. Submit the request

8. Wait for approval (usually takes minutes to a few hours)

9. Once approved, return to your terminal and run:
   $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "terraform-key.json"; terraform apply -auto-approve

This should resolve the quota issue and allow your GKE cluster to be created successfully.
